> I need to setup create-react-app with faker and target folder is UC23

---

Certainly! Follow these steps to set up a new `create-react-app` project with `faker` library, and have the project in the target folder named `UC23`.

1. **Setting up the new React app**:
   
   Open a terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app UC23
   ```

   This command will create a new React app in a folder called `UC23`.

2. **Navigate to the `UC23` directory**:

   ```bash
   cd UC23
   ```

3. **Installing `faker`**:

   `faker` is a library that helps generate massive amounts of fake data in the browser and in the Node.js environment. To install it:

   ```bash
   npm install faker
   ```

4. **Usage**:

   Now, you can import and use the `faker` library in your React components. Here's a simple example:

   Open `src/App.js` in your preferred editor and import faker:

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import logo from './logo.svg';
   import './App.css';
   import faker from 'faker';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <header className="App-header">
           <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
           <p>
             Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
           </p>
           <p>Random name: {faker.name.findName()}</p>
           <a
             className="App-link"
             href="https://reactjs.org"
             target="_blank"
             rel="noopener noreferrer"
           >
             Learn React
           </a>
         </header>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

   This will show a random name from the `faker` library every time you reload the page.

5. **Running the app**:

   While in the `UC23` directory, start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the local development server, and your browser should automatically open displaying your new React app. You should see a random name generated by the `faker` library on your main page.

That's it! You've successfully set up `create-react-app` with the `faker` library in the `UC23` folder.
