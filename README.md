# UC23

This React application generates fake data for movie and series titles as well as associated credits. Once generated, the user can toggle between viewing these two datasets and download them as separate CSV files.

## Features:
Data Generation: On the click of a button, generate fake data for:

Titles (Movies/Series) with attributes like ID, name, description, release year, and more.
Credits associated with these titles, including attributes like role, real name, character name, etc.
Data Viewing: Switch between viewing titles or credits.

Download as CSV: The application allows users to download the currently viewed dataset (either titles or credits) as a CSV file.

## Tech Stack:
React
@faker-js/faker

## Usage:
Click on the "Generate Data" button to produce fake data.
Toggle between "Show Titles" and "Show Credits" to switch the current view.
Click the "Save as CSV" button to download the currently viewed dataset.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
